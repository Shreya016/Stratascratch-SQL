b.area_name, count(distinct customer_id)/NULLIF(b.area_size,0) as customer_density
from transaction_records a inner join stores b on a.store_id=b.store_id group by b.area_name
)
,ranking as(
select 
area_name, customer_density,
dense_rank() over (order by customer_density desc) as rk
from unique_cus 
) select * from ranking where rk<=3;
