Question:
Identify users who started a session and placed an order on the same day. For these users, calculate the total number of orders and the total order value for that day.

Your output should include the user, the session date, the total number of orders, and the total order value for that day.

sessions:

session_date:date
timesession_id:bigint
user_id:bigint

order_summary:
order_date:date
timeorder_id:bigint
order_value:bigint
user_id:bigint


Answer:
select
a.user_id,
a.session_date,
count(b.order_id) as total_no_of_orders,
sum(b.order_value) as total_value_of_orders

from sessions a inner join
order_summary b on a.user_id=b.user_id and a.session_date=b.order_date
group by a.session_date,a.user_id;
